## Overview

This project is an Android/iOS application that connects homeowners with handymen and contractors. Homeowners can post renovation or other home improvement jobs they need done, and contractors can bid on these jobs. The job is awarded to the contractor with the lowest bid.

## Features

- **Bidding System:** Contractors can browse available jobs and place bids. The lowest bid at the end of the bidding period wins the job.
- **User Profiles:** Both homeowners and contractors have profiles where they can manage their posts and bids, view history, and update personal information.
- **Notifications:** Real-time notifications to keep users updated on the status of their posts and bids.
- **Rating System:** After the job is completed, homeowners can rate and review the contractors.
